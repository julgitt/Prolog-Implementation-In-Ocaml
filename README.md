# Prolog implementation in Ocaml 

**Key Features:**
- Unification using Robinson's algorithm.
- Comprehensive support for syntax, semantics, and arithmetic operations.
- Reading the predicate base from a file, while queries are interactively taken from the console.
- Implementation of backtracking with a state monad providing searching for multiple solutions.

**Additional libraries:** Dune, Menhir, Linenoise

**Plans for the future development:**
- support for Prolog lists
- comparison operators
